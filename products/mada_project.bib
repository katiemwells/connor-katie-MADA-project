	abstract = {What is already known about this topic? On December 1, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that health care personnel and long-term care facility residents be offered COVID-19 vaccination first (Phase 1a). What is added by this report? On December 20, ACIP updated interim vaccine allocation recommendations. In Phase 1b, COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to persons aged ≥75 years and non–health care frontline essential workers, and in Phase 1c, to persons aged 65–74 years, persons aged 16–64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not included in Phase 1b. What are the implications for public health practice? Federal, state, and local jurisdictions should use this guidance for COVID-19 vaccination program planning and implementation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To identify variation in several measures of health equity from 1993 to 2017 in the United States and to test whether there are significant time trends. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey study using 25 years of data, from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2017, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to assess trends in health equity and health justice by race/ethnicity, sex, and income in 3 categories by year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Health equity was assessed separately for each of 2 health constructs: healthy days—the average of physical and mental healthy days over the previous 30 days—and general health in 5 categories, rescaled to approximate a continuous variable. For each health construct, average health was calculated along with 4 measures of health equity: disparities across 3 income groups; black-white disparities; health justice—a measure of the correlation of health outcomes with income, race/ethnicity and sex; and a summary health equity metric.
RESULTS Among the 5 456 006 respondents, the mean (SD) age was 44.5 (12.7) years; 3 178 688 (58.3\%) were female; 4 163 945 (76.3\%) were non-Latinx white; 474 855 (8.7\%) were non-Latinx black; 419 542 (7.7\%) were Latinx; and 397 664 (7.3\%) were of other race/ethnicity. The final sample included 5 456 006 respondents for self-reported health and 5 349 527 respondents for healthy days. During the 25-year period, the black-white gap showed significant improvement (year coefficient: healthy days, 0.021; 97.5\% CI, 0.012 to 0.029; P {\textless} .001; self-reported health, 0.030; 97.5\% CI, 0.025 to 0.035; P {\textless} .001). The health equity metric for self-reported health showed no significant trend. For healthy days, the Health Equity Metric declined over time (year coefficient: healthy days, −0.025; 97.5\% CI, −0.033 to −0.017; P {\textless} .001). Health justice declined over time (year coefficient: healthy days, −0.045; 97.5\% CI, −0.053 to −0.038; P {\textless} .001; self-reported health, −0.035; 97.5\% CI, −0.046 to−0.023; P {\textless} .001), and income disparities worsened (year coefficient: healthy days, −0.060; 97.5\% CI, −0.076 to −0.044; P {\textless} .001; self-reported health, −0.029; 97.5\% CI, −0.046 to −0.012; P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this analysis suggest that there has been a clear lack of progress on health equity during the past 25 years in the United States. Achieving widely shared goals of improving health equity will require greater effort from public health policy makers, along with their partners in medicine and the sectors that contribute to the social determinants of health.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Adults from racial and ethnic minorities and low-income groups are disproportionately affected by vaccine-preventable diseases. The objective of this study is to examine the trends in adult vaccination coverage in the U.S. by race/ethnicity and SES from 2010 to 2019.
Methods: Temporal trends in inﬂuenza; pneumococcal; herpes zoster; and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccination coverage were examined by race/ethnicity and SES in 2020 using the National Health Interview Surveys from 2010 to 2019.
Results: Inﬂuenza vaccination coverage differed by race/ethnicity among adults aged ≥65 years (61.4\% for Black, 63.9\% for Hispanic, 71.9\% for Asian, and 72.4\% for White adults). Race/ethnicity, household income, education level, and health insurance type were signiﬁcantly associated with receipt of inﬂuenza; pneumococcal; tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; and zoster vaccinations among adults aged ≥65 years in a multivariable-adjusted regression model. Socioeconomic differences in inﬂuenza vaccine uptake narrowed among adults aged 18−64 years from 2010 to 2019. By contrast, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in vaccine uptake persisted from 2010 to 2019 among adults aged ≥65 years.
Conclusions: Racial and ethnic disparities in vaccine uptake persisted over the last decade. Socioeconomic disparities in inﬂuenza vaccine coverage narrowed among adults aged 18−64 years; however, disparities persisted among adults aged ≥65 years. Efforts are urgently needed to achieve equity in immunization rates.},
